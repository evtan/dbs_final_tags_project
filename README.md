# Final project proposal: Tag recommendations

This project is intended to fulfil a real-world use-case, with the goal to make this project production-ready to be incorporated into software engineering workflows. 

The objective is to develop a text classification solution for tags added to the content on an online knowledge-management platform (think of the tags added to pictures on Pinterest, and the underlying machine learning tag recommendation algorithms behind it), to group and cluster tags by themes as well as to make recommendations on similar and related tags (by text distance and semantically, ideally).
